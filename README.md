The api holds information about binary tree and different kind of trees. It can print out Binary tree in roder, pre order and post order. 

The side is created to combine what we have been learning in different courses and how to use that in real life. 

We are planning on keep working on the side and make it even bigger.

## That is Flask?
Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools. Extensions are updated far more regularly than the core Flask program
